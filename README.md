This Flutter application is for managing personal expenses. It consists of two main classes: `ExpenseTrackerApp` and `ExpenseTrackerHomePage`.The `ExpenseTrackerApp` class sets up the main structure of the application. It uses `MaterialApp` to define the app's title and theme. The theme is configured with primary colors and a custom font. The home screen of the app is set to `ExpenseTrackerHomePage`. The `ExpenseTrackerHomePage` class manages the state of the home screen. It loads data from SharedPreferences when initialized, including total income and existing expenses. Users can add new expenses and income, delete existing expenses, and view a summary of expenses and remaining income. The UI is constructed using various widgets like `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, `TextField`, `DropdownButton`, `Card`, `ListView`, and charts from the `charts_flutter` package. The application stores data persistently using SharedPreferences. Each expense is represented as an instance of the `Expense` class, which contains properties like name, amount, category, and timestamp. The `ExpenseChartData` class is used to represent data for the chart visualization.
Overall, the application provides a user-friendly interface for managing personal expenses, allowing users to track their spending, visualize expense categories, and monitor their remaining income.
